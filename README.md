# ICOM 5016 Fall 2016
## Project Phase I
## Due Date: 11:59 pm, October 12, 2016 
### Introduction
In Phase I of the project you will work with the User Interface (UI) design and ER model of the application. In particular, you will:

1. Implement the UI of the application, whether it is a web-based application (regular o mobile), or an android base application. 
2. Implement a basic backend.  Your UI will communicate with the backend server component, but no real data or connection to the database is required. Instead, the backend component always return the same dummy data to the UI. 
3. Develop an Entity Relationship (ER) diagram specifying the entities and relationships in use. 

Thus, as you can see, in Phase I your application is "hardwired" with dummy data, and you are only working to develop the workflow of screens from login (or registration) to using the features of your app.
